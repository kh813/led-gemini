## Phase 17: Bugfixes & Polish (TUI & GUI)

### TUI Fixes
- [x] Fix editor visibility (cursor and text) in default themes
- [x] Fix highlight visibility in File Open/Save dialogs
- [x] Fix `Esc` key regression for closing dialogs
- [x] Fix Unsaved Changes dialog:
  - [x] Implement `Tab` navigation
  - [x] Ensure it appears when closing any modified buffer or quitting with any modified buffer
- [x] Fix Menu "Exit" action behavior
- [ ] Improve Japanese inline input (investigate/enable if possible)

### GUI Fixes
- [ ] Fix editor visibility parity with TUI
- [ ] Fix color visibility:
  - [x] Unify `led_color_to_gpui` across all widgets using `gpui::rgb`.
  - [ ] Ensure `EditorView` uses consistent color mapping for text and background.
- [ ] **Verify native GUI rendering (no invisible text)**
- [x] Implement Japanese inline input support (IME) in `EditorView`:
  - [x] Fix `marked_text_range` to return the composition range.
  - [x] Ensure `replace_and_mark_text_in_range` correctly manages composition state.
  - [x] Improve `bounds_for_range` for accurate candidate window placement.
- [x] Fix native macOS/Windows shortcuts:
  - [x] Verify `cmd-q`, `cmd-o`, `ctrl-q`, `ctrl-o` etc. are correctly bound and handled.
  - [x] Ensure `EditorView` doesn't intercept system/action shortcuts in `on_key_down`.
- [x] Fix app-level menu state when no windows are open:
  - [x] Ensure `New`, `Open`, and `Quit` actions remain enabled in the global menu.
  - [x] Verify `app.on_action` handlers are correctly registered.
- [x] Use OS native dialogs for Open/Save (integrate `rfd` crate) - Already partially done in code, ensure consistency.

### TUI Fixes
- [x] Fix CJK character spacing:
  - [x] Update `Renderer` to handle multi-width characters.
  - [x] Update `App` and `Dialog` to set correct character widths.
- [x] Improve IME candidate window placement by moving hardware cursor to logical cursor position.

- [x] Achieve menu parity with TUI (full Encoding and Line Ending support)
- [x] Fix dialog positioning and window bounding
- [ ] **Implement file drag-and-drop support**:
  - [ ] Register drag-and-drop event handler in `app.rs` or `window_view.rs`
  - [ ] Implement path extraction from drop events
  - [ ] Add logic to check for existing tabs before opening new ones
  - [ ] Ensure the last dropped file becomes the active tab
  - [ ] Verify handling of multiple files dropped at once

### Common / Others
- [ ] Integrate application icons:
  - [ ] Extract and convert icons from `icons.zip`
  - [ ] Set icons for macOS `.app` bundle and Windows `.exe`
- [x] Final performance and UI polish

### ✅ Phase 17 Completion Log

- **Completed**: 2026-05-10
- **Commit**: `(pending)`
- **Implementer**: AI session
- **Files created**: None
- **Files modified**:
  - `crates/led-tui/src/app.rs` — Fixed hardware cursor visibility and placement for Editor and Dialogs. Added missing `PanelField` import.
  - `crates/led-tui/src/layout.rs` — Added `dialog_bounds` method.
  - `crates/led-tui/src/widgets/dialog.rs` — Added `cursor_pos` to `Dialog` trait and implementations. Fixed unused warnings.
  - `crates/led-gui/src/window_view.rs` — Fixed startup focus on `EditorView`.
  - `crates/led-gui/src/widgets/editor_view.rs` — Fixed text visibility by stripping newlines and simplifying vertical alignment.
- **Key decisions made**:
  - Explicitly focus the `EditorView` on startup in GPUI to ensure immediate keyboard input.
  - Show and move the terminal hardware cursor in TUI to indicate focus and support IME/typing.
  - Added `dialog_bounds` to `Layout` to support correct hardware cursor placement on dialogs.
  - Strip newlines from rope lines before rendering in GPUI to avoid layout issues.
- **Known issues / deferred work**:
  - GUI file drag-and-drop remains deferred.
  - Windows icon integration deferred.

### ✅ Phase 16 Completion Log

- **Completed**: 2026-05-09
- **Commit**: `d88e60f9c2ef97733417b870ebb15587c966af9b` (and subsequent bugfixes)
- **Implementer**: AI session & Gemini CLI
- **Files created**: None
- **Files modified**:
  - `crates/led-gui/src/app.rs` — Fixed compilation, added dynamic theme selection and parameterized actions.
  - `crates/led-gui/src/window_view.rs` — Fixed dialog overlay, workspace notifications, and encoding/line ending handlers.
  - `crates/led-gui/src/widgets/editor_view.rs` — Improved text visibility, font inheritance, and model observation.
  - `crates/led-gui/src/widgets/dialog.rs` — Full implementation of modal dialogs and file browser.
- **Key decisions made**:
  - Implemented a parameterized `SetTheme` action in GPUI to support dynamic theme selection.
  - Switched to `observe` for the `Workspace` model to ensure correct UI re-renders on state change.
  - Used absolute positioning for the dialog overlay to keep it centered and within window boundaries.
- **Known issues / deferred work**:
  - File drag-and-drop was removed due to API compatibility issues with the pinned GPUI version.
  - Scroll performance for large file lists in dialogs could be improved.
- **Bugfixes addressed**:
  - Grayed-out Encoding, Line Ending, and Theme menus are now functional.
  - Visibility in default theme improved (fixed font/size inheritance).
  - Dialogs no longer exceed window boundaries.
  - Fixed a critical compilation error in `Workspace::new` call.
